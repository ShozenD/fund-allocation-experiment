# Budget Allocation Experiment

## Introduction
This is the web page for the budget allocation experiment conducted by Ph.D. candidate Slande Erole at the University of California, Davis. The code was implemented by Shozen Dan an exchange student from Keio University(Japan) at UC Davis.

### Abstract
As more and more women attain legislative office, the assumption is that descriptive representation will inevitably translate into substantive representation. However, the question remains- how does descriptive representation translate into substantive representation? Moreover, if the effects of gender on legislative behavior are conditioned on certain institutional features of legislatures, then additional studies of the interaction of gender and legislative institutions are sorely needed. To date, little experimental work examines potential differences between men and women in their legislative decision-making. This study seeks to extend experimental work into the legislative arena and explore the mechanisms through which gender exerts an effect on legislative behavior. I draw on previous experimental research of the behavior differences between men and women and the dynamics of legislative decision-making, and offer an allocation exercise as a lens through which to examine gender differences in substantive representation under institutional constraints that mirror those present in most democratic legislatures.
