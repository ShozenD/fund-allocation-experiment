        <p align="left">Your job is to either select or create an allocation of $20 to the same five organizations you donated to
          previously. The allocation that you select or create will be put up for a vote by all of the members of the
          group. To help you with this task, you will be provided with all of the allocations members of your group
          proposed previously. You can either select an allocation from the ones provided to you (including your own),
          or
          you can create an entirely new one to put up for a vote. Other members of the group will also be provided with
          all of the allocations members proposed previously.</p>
