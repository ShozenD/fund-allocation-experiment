          We previously asked you, individually, to allocate funds between five (5) non-profit
          organizations. Now, we are asking that you come to an agreement <b>AS A GROUP</b> about how to spend $100 between these five (5) organizations. A <b>majority of the group (50% + 1)</b> must be in agreement about the allocation.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
          One member of the group will be randomly selected as the leader. The leader will be provided with the allocations of all group members and will be <b>tasked with selecting <u>one</u> budget to put up for a group vote</b>. Everyone will also be provided with the budgets of all group members. Again, the budget will only pass if a majority (50% + 1) of members support it.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
          Once an allocation is agreed to, we will calculate the absolute difference between the amount given to an organization by the group and the amount  donated to the organization earlier. We will add up the differences for all five (5) groups. This amount will then be subtracted from the $100 <b>you</b> received at the start.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
          Your goal in this part of the study is to adopt an allocation that <b>minimizes the difference between the group's allocation and your own as much as possible.</b> that at the end of the study, one allocation will be randomly selected. If your allocation is the one which is randomly selected, "Your Earnings" in this of the study will be sent to whichever organization that you had allocated the most amount of funds to. See the table below for an example.
