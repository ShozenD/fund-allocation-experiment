      You will now be asked to <b>allocate $20 among</b> five non-profit organizations.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">You must make allocations in increments of $1, and <b>every organization must receive
        at least $1</b>.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">An allocation constraint is strictly enforced so that you may need to decrease
      funding from one organization in order to increase funding for another.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      At the end of the study, one of the allocations from phase I (yours or somebody elseâ€™s) will be randomly selected.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">If your allocation is selected, <b>we will mail the amounts that you allocated to the
      various organizations to them directly</b>. Thus, it is important that you allocate the $20 so that it accords
      with your wishes, as it could be the one selected.
