      We hope to learn more about individual decision making processes through this study, and we plan to share what we learn by publishing the results of this work in scholarly outlets. Research sometimes requires that information regarding its purpose not be shared with the research participants because its knowledge could impact the results of the research. While the tasks you will be asked to perform for this research have been explained, the full intent of the research will not be provided until the completion of the study. At that time you will have the opportunity to ask questions, including about the purpose of the study and the procedures used. Note that none of the aspects of the research being withheld are reasonably expected to affect your willingness to participate.
